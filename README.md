- 👋 Hi, I’m @jeffpodmayer
- 👀 I’m interested in full stack web development in Java, React, Spring, Hibernate and MySQL. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to leverage TypeScript & React to build awesome user interfaces and single page applications.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open source project that is focused on making a positive impact in the world.

- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I worked for 10 years at a non-profit called Outward Bound where I took youth on 2-3 week backpacking and rock climbing expedtions. This led me to develop V1 of a backcountry meal planning application.
