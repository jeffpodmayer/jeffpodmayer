## ðŸ‘‹ Hey I'm Jeff....
I am a Full Stack Developer specializing in Java, React, Spring, MySQL, and JavaScript. I have experience with Maven, Hibernate (ORM Framework), Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring MVC, and Spring Data JPA), Thymeleaf, JSON & RESTful APIs, MySQL Workbench, and using Git/GitHub for version control. Over the last 10 years, I've gained teamwork and leadership skills in non-profit youth development environments requiring quick thinking, self-reliance, and creative problem-solving, which have refined my interpersonal skills. I am excited to be a positive, teamwork-focused, and solutions-oriented member of any technical team!
